## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0-beta.1]

First public beta.

### Added

- Deterministic controller (`mycelink` CLI) and Claude Code plugin: one
  approved PRD becomes a four-layer portfolio graph, dependency-scheduled
  worker sessions in isolated git worktrees, per-repository
  `feature/<id>` integration branches, one immutable cross-repository
  candidate, and evidence-based completion.
- Strict TDD gates (RED must fail for a missing behaviour; GREEN re-runs the
  same command), bounded retries and budgets, failure fingerprints,
  capacity-bounded resource leases, E2E conflict scheduling, fresh
  verification and an optional LLM Wiki Brain memory adapter.
- Project-scoped enforcement hooks installed by `mycelink init`.
- Plan-source adapter registry (`mycelink graph adapters`,
  `mycelink graph import`); the ECC adapter is optional and validated against
  the documented artifact shape only.
- Security hardening: path containment with symlink/junction resolution;
  refusal of UNC, extended-length, device and reserved-name paths; validated
  feature/node/candidate ids and git ref names; argv-only command execution
  with an explicit, config-gated shell mode; Windows batch-shim argument
  checks; secret redaction in evidence, logs, ledgers, context packs and
  session logs; PID-reuse-safe session reconciliation; candidate manifests
  bound to their id and feature.
- Self-contained runtime bundle (`dist/mycelink.mjs`) so marketplace and
  release-ZIP installs need no `npm install` and no TypeScript build.
- Deterministic release packaging with SHA-256 checksum and SPDX 2.3 SBOM.
